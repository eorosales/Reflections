When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

  Using a remote repository on GitHub would be perfect for working on a project with multiple contributors. This can also be especially helpful when keeping in mind version control and having the ability to track the work of others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	I would want to pull changes manually just in case I may be working on something that the up-date may interrupt or conflict with.
